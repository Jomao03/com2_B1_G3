    The e_CE_VCO_fc block is a VCO 
    designed to operate in the baseband 
    domain, generating a complex envelope 
    from two input signals: a magnitude 
    A(t) and a phase Q(t). In the formula
    for the complex envelope, A(t) represents
    the in-phase component, while Q(t) 
    corresponds to the instantaneous phase
    (or the quadrature component, when 
    interpreted from the perspective of an
    I/Q modulator). The output is therefore
    a complex signal that encapsulates all 
    amplitude and phase modulation 
    information,enabling the signal to
    be analyzed or transmitted without
    the need to upconvert it directly
    to the radiofrequency (RF) domain."""
